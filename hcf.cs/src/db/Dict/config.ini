[locale]
default = "de_DE"; default locale which will be used, if no other value was specified at runtime; if no value for the target-locale was found, the default locale will be used as fallback
cookie.name = "page-settings"; lookup for a cookie with this name, that contains the locale
cookie.offset = "lang"; inside the cookie above, this key points to the locale, implied that the cookie-content is a JSON -> page-settings = {"lang": "de_DE", "other-settings": {...}}

emulate = false; emulate the connection below - good for "offline" development - the key will be used as value
name = "hcf.db.Connection"; a hcf.db.Connection
table.name = "hcf.db.Dict"; name of your table
table.col.key = "key"; name of the column, which holds the unique key of each entry
table.col.locale = "locale"; the locale, which defines the language
table.col.value = "value"; the actual text section in the correct language
table.col.comment = "comment"; additional comments for further developing can be stored here
